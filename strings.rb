"""
A String object in Ruby holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of one or more bytes,
typically representing characters that represent human language.

The simplest string literals are enclosed in single quotes (the apostrophe character).
 The text within the quote marks is the value of the string −


The backslash also works to escape another backslash,
so that the second backslash is not itself interpreted as an escape character.
Following are the string-related features of Ruby."""


puts 'This is a simple Ruby string literal'

# If you need to place an apostrophe within a single-quoted string literal,
# precede it with a backslash, so that the Ruby interpreter does not think that it terminates the string −
puts 'Won\'t you read O\'Reilly\'s book?'
