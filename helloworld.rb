Whitespace in Ruby Program

Whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs are generally ignored in Ruby code,
except when they appear in strings. Sometimes, however, they are used to interpret
ambiguous statements.
Interpretations of this sort produce warnings when the -w option is enabled.
Example

a + b is interpreted as a+b ( Here a is a local variable)
a  +b is interpreted as a(+b) ( Here a is a method call)

Line Endings in Ruby Program

Ruby interprets semicolons and newline characters as the ending of a statement.
However, if Ruby encounters operators, such as +, −, or backslash at the end of a line,
they indicate the continuation of a statement.
